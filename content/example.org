* Introduction

#+begin_marginnote
This is a block margin note at the start of a section.
It demonstrates that we can have margin notes with:
- Multiple paragraphs
- Lists
- /Italics/ and *bold* text
- Even [[https://example.com][links]]
#+end_marginnote

This is a demonstration of various ox-tufte features. Here's a regular paragraph with an inline margin note [[mn:][This is an unnumbered margin note]]. Notice how it flows with the text.

Now let's use a numbered margin note [fn:1:This will be numbered]. We can have as many numbered notes as we want.

* Using Different Types of Notes

Regular text here [fn:2:Another numbered note with /italic/ and *bold* text]. The margin notes can contain formatting.

This paragraph has a longer note [[mn:][A longer margin note that contains multiple sentences. This shows how margin notes handle longer content and remain readable in the margins]].

* Working with Lists

1. First item with a note [fn:3:Notes work well with lists]
2. Second item
3. Third item with note [fn:4:Another note in a list]

* Block Margin Notes with Code

This section demonstrates a block margin note with code.

#+begin_marginnote
Here's some code in a margin note:

#+begin_src python
def hello():
    return "Hello!"
#+end_src

The code is properly formatted.
#+end_marginnote

The text continues after the block with code.

* Epigraphs Example

#+begin_epigraph
#+begin_quote
The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
#+end_quote

#+caption: Alan Kay
#+end_epigraph

* Full-width Content

Some regular width content followed by a full-width section:

#+begin_export html
<figure class="fullwidth">
<img src="/api/placeholder/800/400" alt="A full-width placeholder"/>
<figcaption>
This is a full-width figure caption
</figcaption>
</figure>
#+end_export

* Special Typography

#+begin_export html
<span class="newthought">This paragraph</span>
#+end_export 
begins with small caps using the newthought class, which is a typical Tufte style.

* Tables and Figures

| Name   | Value |
|--------+-------|
| First  |    10 |
| Second |    20 |
| Third  |    30 |

#+begin_marginnote
Tables can have margin notes too! This explains the data in the table.
#+end_marginnote

* Final Notes

This concludes our demonstration of ox-tufte features [fn:5:A final numbered note to wrap things up].
