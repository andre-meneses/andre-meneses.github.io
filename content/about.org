I'm André.

Computer engineer, currently pursuing a doctorate at Polytechnique Montréal. My research will likely involve combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and methods like branch and bound, but it’s still taking shape.

This blog is a logbook. A place to store thoughts I don’t want to lose, predictions I’ll probably regret, and notes that may (or may not) become something larger.

I’m not trying to teach anything here, I'm just thinking in public, and using writing as a way to do that slightly better.

This site will likely change over time. That’s the point.
